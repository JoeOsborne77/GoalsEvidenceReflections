Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team has made commits and can; explain why any part of the application exists and how any aspect of the application works. Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request. Commit messages are clear and composed of; a single line describing the changes made, a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user. The linter passes on all commits. All commits have a low complexity score. All pull requests are peer reviewed. There is up-to-date documentation; a project description - How to install and run it and how to run tests. |                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                  |           | [WEEK 8-9](#WEEK-8-9-EVIDENCE)        |
