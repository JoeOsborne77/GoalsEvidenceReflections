| VIII - IX | ENGINEERING PROJECT: 90% or greater test coverage. You can articulate why any test does or does not exist. Every feature is tested from the user's perspective. Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team has made commits and can; explain why any part of the application exists and how any aspect of the application works. Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request. Commit messages are clear and composed of; a single line describing the changes made, a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user. The linter passes on all commits. All commits have a low complexity score. All pull requests are peer reviewed. There is up-to-date documentation; a project description - How to install and run it and how to run tests. |                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |                       |
| X         | INDIVIDUAL CHALLENGES: By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question: Can you solve a challenging technical problem by writing well crafted code? By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change. Secondary goals By the end of the week, you should: Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test. Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |                       |
| XI - XII  | FINAL PROJECT: By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question: Can you use high-quality processes to build an extended project in a team? Production code is generally built by a team of developers. It is important that you leave Makers with the skills needed to work in a team, and this is the primary reason that project weeks exist in the curriculum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |                       |
