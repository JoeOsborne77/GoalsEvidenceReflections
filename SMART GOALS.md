| VIII - IX | ENGINEERING PROJECT 90% or greater test coverage. Unit tests: test one piece of your own logic. Fail if that logic breaks. Pass if  that logic produces the expected result. You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist). Every feature is tested from the user's perspective. Good distribution of work Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team can: explain why any part of the application exists (what user need it solves). explain how any aspect of the application works. Every member of the team has made commits. Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request. Quality of work Commit messages are clear and composed of: a single line describing the changes made. a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user. The linter passes on all commits. All commits have a low complexity score. All pull requests are peer reviewed. Documentation There is up-to-date documentation: a project description. how to install and run it. how to run tests. |                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |          |

By "well crafted code", we mean code that is well tested, easy to read and easy to change.  Secondary goals By the end of the week, you should:  Feel more confident in your ability to complete a tech test. Have developed a structured process to approaching complex problems, utilising TDD and good OO design skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |          |

Production code is generally built by a team of developers. It is important that you leave Makers with the skills needed to work in a team, and this is the primary reason that project weeks exist in the curriculum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                  |           |          |
