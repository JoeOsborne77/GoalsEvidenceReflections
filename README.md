# MAKERS ACADEMY 2022
## GOALS, EVIDENCE & REFLECTIONS

Hello. Welcome to my 'GER' page and my journey to become a Junior Software Developer.

I will use this space to reflect on my time at Makers Academy as well as projects, specific weeks and general insights in learning how to learn. I am willfully trying to adopt the [Ready Position](https://sjmog.github.io/posts/491_learning_to_learn_1/) and [Pomodoro Technique](https://images.prismic.io/sketchplanations/62e61034-b66a-4ede-a5db-a5cbc39d55e7_SP+587+-+The+Pomodoro+technique.jpg?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.0.3&h=1887.557603686636&w=1600), which have already proven effective. 

Feel free to say hi üëã and take a look around. I have used the amazing framework from Makers to outline my goals, subgoals and use evidence to reinforce my understanding on specific topics, techniques, programming languages and other dev tools and concepts.

## POST COURSE REFLECTION 
Throughout the course I thoroughly enjoyed learning about my own prefered styles of learning. Seeing which things were sticking and which  weren't and why was a rewarding and necessary process. The main takeaway for me is that I enjoy a balance of everything;
- Listening to and taking notes in workshops
- Pairing and asking questions to my peers
- Researching online (mostly prefer video / visual learning in this instance)
- Deep solo work, particularly in the evenings I find it easier to enter 'flow-state'
- Last but not least getting my hands dirty and hands on learning

I found a balance of all of them and being clear about setting a rhythm and boundaries with pairing etc. to be really effective and feel I got a lot out of all of these different methods and can now apply them to my career and various aspects of my life!
