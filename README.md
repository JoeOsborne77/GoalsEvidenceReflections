# Joe's Learning Journey

Hello. Welcome to my learning journey.

I will use this space to reflect on my time at Makers Academy as well as projects, specific weeks and general insights in learning how to learn. I am willfully trying to adopt the [Ready Position](https://sjmog.github.io/posts/491_learning_to_learn_1/) and [Pomodoro Technique](https://images.prismic.io/sketchplanations/62e61034-b66a-4ede-a5db-a5cbc39d55e7_SP+587+-+The+Pomodoro+technique.jpg?auto=format&ixlib=react-9.0.3&h=1887.557603686636&w=1600), which have already proven effective. 

Feel free to say hi üëã and take a look around. I have used the amazing framework from Makers to outline my goals, subgoals and use evidence to reinforce my understanding on specific topics, techniques, programming languages and other dev tools and concepts.
