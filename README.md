# LearningJourney

Hello. Welcome to my learning journey.

I will use this space to reflect on learnings from my time at Makers Academy as well as general learnings about learning about learning about learning #inception. 

Feel free to take a look around. I have used the amazing framework from Makers to outline goals,
subgoals and use evidence to reinforce my understanding on specific topics, techniques, programming languages and other dev tools and concepts.
