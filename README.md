Hello. Welcome to my learning journey.

I will use this space to reflect on learnings from my time at Makers Academy as well as general learnings about learning about learning about learning #inception. 

Feel free to take a look around. I have used the amazing framework from Makers to outline goals,
subgoals and use evidence to reinforce my understanding on specific techniques, programming languages and other dev tools and concepts. 

Please take a look at my projects and check out my blog too; https://medium.com/@joeosborne77
